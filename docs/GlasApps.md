# Glas Applications

Glas applications, at least for [Glas CLI](GlasCLI.md) verbs, will be modeled by a 1--1 arity program that represents a multi-step process over time, where each step is evaluated atomically within a transaction.

        type Process = (init:Params | step:State) â†’ [Effects] (halt:Result | step:State) | Failure

An application process is started with 'init', voluntarily terminates by returning 'halt', or may return 'step' to continue in a future transaction, carrying state. Intermediate outputs and latent inputs can be modeled effectfully. Failure aborts the transaction but does not halt the application, implicitly waiting for changes or (in context of non-deterministic choice effects) implicitly searching for a choice that does not result in failure.

This application model, which I call a *Transaction Machine*, has nice systemic properties regarding extensibility, composability, concurrency, distribution, reactivity, and live coding. Administrative control, debugging, and orthogonal persistence can be implemented as extensions that work with application state between steps. However, transaction machines depend on sophisticated optimizations. Implementation of the optimizer is the main development barrier for this model.

## Transaction Machines

Transaction machines model software systems as an open set of repeating, atomic, isolated transactions in a shared environment. Scheduling of transactions is non-deterministic. This is a simple idea, but has many nice properties, especially when optimized. 

### Waiting and Reactivity

If nothing changes, repeating a deterministic, unproductive transaction is guaranteed to again be unproductive. The system can recognize a simple subset of unproductive transactions and defer repetition until a relevant change occurs. Essentially, we can optimize a busy-wait into triggering updates on change.

The most obvious unproductive transaction is the failed transaction. Thus, aborting a transaction expresses waiting for changes. For example, if we abort a transaction after it fails to read from an empty channel, we'll implicitly wait on updates to the channel. Successful transactions are unproductive if we know repetition writes the same values to the same variables. Optimizing the success case would support spreadsheet-like evaluation of transaction machines.

Further, incremental computing can be supported. Instead of fully recomputing each transaction, it is feasible to implement repetition as rolling back to the earliest change in observed input and recomputing from there. We can design applications to take advantage of this optimization by first reading relatively stable variables, such as configuration data, then read unstable variables near end of transaction. This results in a tight 'step' loop that also reacts swiftly to changes in configuration data.

### Concurrency and Parallelism

Repeating a single transaction that makes a non-deterministic binary choice is equivalent to repeating two transactions that are identical until this choice then deterministically diverge. We can optimize non-deterministic choice using replication. Usefully, each replica can be stable under incremental computation. Introducing a non-deterministic choice effect enables a single repeating transaction to represent a dynamic set of repeating transactions.

Transactions in the set will interact via shared state. Useful interaction patterns such as channels and mailboxes can be modeled and typefully abstracted within shared state. Transactional updates and ability to wait on flexible conditions also mitigates many challenges of working directly with shared state.

Concurrent transactions can evaluate in parallel insofar as they avoid read-write conflict. When conflict does occur, one transaction will be aborted by the system while the other proceeds. The system can record a conflict history to heuristically schedule transactions to reduce risk of conflict. Additionally, applications can be architected to avoid conflict, using intermediate buffers and staging areas to reduce contention.

### Distribution 

Application state can be partitioned and mirrored across physically separated machines. A random distribution will be inefficient, requiring a distributed transaction for every step. With careful application design and annotation-guided distribution, we can arrange for most transactions to be machine-local, and further optimize most communication between machines.

For example, transaction machines can model a basic channel using a write buffer, a read buffer, and a data plumbing task that repeatedly moves data from (local) write buffer to (potentially remote) read buffer. Data previously in the read buffer is not observed and ideally shouldn't be serialized by this transaction. Ideally, the system would recognize this transaction and optimize it into a simple update message with acknowledgement.

Transaction machines are inherently resilient to network disruption. Operations within each network partition may continue unabated. Operations that communicate between network partitions fail temporarily, then implicitly continue when connectivity is re-established. This behavior is convenient for short-term disruption. Long-term disruption should be handled by weak synchronization patterns within the application, such as pushback buffers and heartbeats.

### Transaction Fusion

It is possible to apply [loop optimizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_optimization) to repeating transactions. Conceptually, we might view this as refining the non-deterministic transaction schedule. A random schedule isn't optimal because we must assume external updates to state between steps. By fusing transactions, we eliminate concurrent interference and enable optimization at the boundary. An optimizer can search for fusions that best improve performance. 

Fusion could be implemented by a just-in-time compiler based on empirical observations, or ahead-of-time based on static analysis. Intriguingly, just-in-time fusions can potentially optimize communication between multiple independent applications and services. In context of distributed transaction machines, each application or service essentially becomes an patch on a network overlay without violating security abstractions.

### Real-Time Systems 

Transaction machines can wait on the clock by (logically) aborting a transaction until a desired time is reached. Assuming the system knows the time the transaction is waiting for, the system can schedule the transaction precisely and efficiently, avoiding busy-waits from watching the clock. Usefully, the system can precompute a transaction slightly ahead of time, such that effects apply almost exactly on time.

Further, we could varify that critical transactions evaluate with worst-case timing under controllable stability assumptions. This enables "hard" real-time systems to be represented.

### Live Coding

The application program can be updated at runtime between transactions. This would naturally destabilize incremental computing and concurrent replicas, but those can be swiftly regenerated. Application state would immediately be handled by the updated transaction.

Transaction machines are only a partial solution for live coding. The application must also include transition logic for the state value, as needed, or must be careful to use a stable state type across application versions. Thus, support from the development environment is the other major part of the solution.

## Procedural Programming on Transaction Machines

Procedural code is a good fit for some applications, especially for short-running tasks where the implicit state doesn't become a problem. In context of a transaction machine, a procedure is evaluated over multiple transactional steps. Blocking calls are implicitly modeled by retry on step failure. A procedure's call-by-value parameters and return value can be represented with init and halt. The implicit continuation and local variables will be represented in the procedure's continuation.

Concurrency keywords and atomic blocks are useful extensions for procedural programs. To model concurrent interaction between procedure calls, we use shared variables or channels. Syntactically this can be represented similarly to pass-by-reference in many PLs. Reads and writes of the shared variables is probably best represented effectfully.

*Note:* Procedures can be separately compiled into transactional processes then composed. This is convenient for flexible integration. However, some optimizations will likely be easier to perform at the procedural layer. 

## Concrete Design

### Initial Performance Mitigation

Before optimizations are available, programmers should avoid use of concurrency. Failed transactions could cause evaluation to pause for a few milliseconds before retrying. There is no incremental computing, but programmers could use manual approaches such as maintaining an event queue or dirty bits in state. This is adequate for simple single-threaded apps, but it won't scale nicely to waiting on many input sources.

### Robust References

Conventional APIs return allocated references to the client, e.g. `open file` returns a file handle. However, this design is unstable under concurrency and difficult to secure. A more robust API design for references is to have applications allocate their own references. For example, `open file as foo` where `foo` is a user-provided value. 

Further operations such as read and close would then use `foo` value to reference the open file. The host would maintain a translation table between application references and runtime objects. Compared to system allocation of references, it is much easier to secure which references a subprogram may use, e.g. based on prefix. References can be stable and meaningful, which should simplify debugging and reflection. Allocation of references can be decentralized, reducing contention on a central allocator.

### Asynchronous Effects

Effects must be aborted when evaluation fails. Compared to distributed transactions, it's a lot easier to write messages into a local buffer then send on commit. Ease of implementation will impact API designs, favoring asynchronous effects.

A useful exception is stable, cacheable reads. For example, loading a module from the module system, or reading a file's content, or even HTTP GET could potentially be performed within a transaction. In some cases, we might also read the age or staleness of the cached value.

## Common Effects APIs

Effects should be designed for transaction machines yet suitable for procedural code to simplify embeddings.

### Time

Transactions are logically instantaneous. The concept of 'timeout' or 'sleep' is incompatible with transactions. However, we can constrain a transaction to commit before or after a given time. We can also estimate time of commit then abort if the estimate is too far off. Proposed effects API:

* **time:now** - Response is an estimated, logical time of commit, as a TimeStamp value.
* **time:check:TimeStamp** - If 'now' is equal or greater to TimeStamp, respond with unit. Otherwise fail.

Time 'check' provides stable, monotonic, indirect observation of time. If a transaction aborts after a failed time check, the runtime can implicitly wait for specified time (or other relevant changes) to retry. Time check is useful for modeling timeouts and scheduling.

Reading 'now' will always destabilize a transaction, so it's best read after the transaction is unstable for other reasons, such as processing an incoming message from a channel.

By default, I suggest timestamps are in NT time: a natural number of 100ns intervals since midnight Jan 1, 1601 UT. 

### Concurrency

Repetition and replication are equivalent for isolated transactions. In context of a transaction machine, within the stable prefix of a transaction, fork can be implemented efficiently by replication, essentially spawning a thread for each stable choice. Outside this context, fork can be implemented with probabilistic choice.

* **fork** - Response is a non-deterministic choice of boolean value '0' or '1'. 

Fork is abstractly a function of time. That is, the sequence of fork choices is logically frozen when a transaction starts. This is relevant in context of hierarchical transactions, to protect optimizations related to eliminating redundant computation.

*Note:* In some cases, we'll want to fork on a dynamic collection of values. This results in potential instability, where updating the collection requires recomputing many unrelated forks. This can be mitigated by first computing a relatively stable index of values.

### Distribution

Application state is represented in the `step:State` tree value. Instead of partitioning and replicating variables across machines, an optimizer can separate state into components then distribute those. Effects can also be localized to machines where appropriate, e.g. `at:(loc:MachineRef, do:LocalEffect)`, allowing for local clocks and filesystems.

Any transaction that interacts with state or effects on multiple machines is naturally a distributed transaction. Communication is based on distributed transactions, but optimizing certain patterns. For example, we can heavily optimize a transaction that moves data between channel buffers on different machines. Read-only access to replicated state can potentially be optimized to use point-to-point updates if we also model 'time' as a machine-local effect (to avoid observing inconsistency between state and time).

In case of network partitioning, each partition continues to evaluate in isolation, but distributed transactions are blocked. When networks partitions reconnect, the distributed transactions can immediately continue running. This results in very good default resilience for short-lived network disruptions, but programs should explicitly handle long-term disruptions, e.g. via timeouts or pushback (waiting when write buffers are full).

### Logging

Logging is a convenient approach to debugging. We can easily support a logging effect. Alternatively, we could introduce logging as a special debugging annotation, similar to breakpoints and profiling. 

* **log:Message** - Response is unit. Arbitrary output message, useful for progress reports or debugging.

By convention, a log message should be a record of ad-hoc fields, whose meanings are de-facto standardized, such as `(lv:warn, text:"I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.", from:hal)`. This enables the record to be extended with rendering hints and other useful features.

In context of transaction machines and fork-based concurrency, logs might be presented as a stable tree (aligned with forks) potentially with unstable leaf nodes. Logically, the entire tree updates, every frame, but log messages in the stable prefix of a fork will also be stable outputs. Further, messages logged by failed transactions might be observable indirectly via reflection, perhaps rendered in a distinct color.

### Random Data

For optimization and security purposes, it's necessary to distinguish non-deterministic choice from reading random data. If a transaction fails after reading random data, the same data may be read when the transaction is repeated. There is no implicit search for a 'successful' random choice. This might be implemented by maintaining a buffer per stable fork path.

* **random:Count** - response is requested count of cryptographically secure, uniformly random bits, represented as a bitstring. E.g. `random:8` might return `0b00101010`.

Many applications would be better off using deterministic pseudo-random data or noise models (such as Perlin noise) instead of random data. But access to secure random data is convenient in some use cases, and necessary for cryptographic communications.

## Misc Thoughts

### Console Applications

See [Glas command line interface](GlasCLI.md).

### Notebook Applications

I like the idea of building notebook-style applications, where each statement is also an application with its own little GUI. Live coding should be implicit, such that code for each component is easily edited through the composite GUI view and has an immediate impact on behavior. The applications should be connected by various means, perhaps forming a *Reactive Dataflow Network*.

The GUI must be efficiently composable, such that a composite application can obtain GUI views from each component application. Ideally, we can also support multiple views and concurrent users. An API based on serving GUI connections is viable. It isn't convenient for a composite to explicitly bind GUI connections to each component application, but we could possibly design a GUI API that supports abstract routing through subchannels.

Mixing live code with the GUI is also a challenge, made a little more difficult because Glas supports user-defined syntax, graphical programming, and staged metaprogramming. Applications shouldn't responsible for rendering or updating their own code, so this feature should mostly be supported via language modules (or associated modules per language). But it also constrains the GUI model, at least insofar as we might need to request fine-grained views for component apps.

A remaining concern is how component applications should communicate, such as manually wiring them together or plugging them into a shared database, databus, or publish-subscribe layer. Fortunately, this choice doesn't need to be made up front. It is feasible to support multiple heterogeneous types of application components and compositions within a larger application, assuming they all share the GUI effects model and 

### User Interface APIs

Initial GUI for command line interface applications will likely just be serving HTTP connections. But for notebook applications, we might benefit from a higher level API such that we can do more structured composition before converting the GUI to lower level code. About the only idea I'm solid on is that processes should accept and 'serve' a GUI connections, without needing an extra step to listen for connections on a specific 'port', e.g. **ui:accept:(as:UIRef)** returning a requested view. 

### Web Applications

A promising target for Glas is web applications, compiling applications to JavaScript and using effects oriented around on Document Object Model, XMLHttpRequest, WebSockets, and Local Storage. Transaction machines are a decent fit for web apps. And we could also adapt notebook applications to the web target.

### Process Networks

We can model process networks or flow-based programming with a relatively simple effects API for operations on external channels:

* **c:send:(over:ChannelRef, data:Value)** - write arbitrary data to a named channel. 
* **c:recv:(from:ChannelRef)** - read data from a named channel. Fails if read buffer is empty. 

Channel references are local to a process, and will be wired externally by a composite process. Thus, we would benefit from some metadata or type information about which channels a process uses, and perhaps the datatypes and patterns of use. Session types could be useful for this purpose.

Processes can use effects other than sending messages on channels, such as filesystem or physical network access. This would require either that the composite process either know all the effects APIs used, so it can rewrite references, or conventions for partitioning references such as adding a prefix that is provided as a static input to each process definition.

### Dynamic Process Networks and Object Oriented Programming

A channel essentially enables communication with a remote object, abstracting over latency and routing. With dynamic process networks, we can model object oriented software design patterns. This would use asynchronous communications under-the-hood, but a program syntax could support synchronous calls then compile down to an asynchronous state machines. A syntax could hide the asynchronous mechanisms. A viable effects API:

* **c:send:(data:Value, over:ChannelRef)** - send a value over a channel. Return value is unit.
* **c:recv:(from:ChannelRef)** - receive data from a channel. Return value is the data. Fails if no input available or if next input isn't data (try 'accept').
* **c:attach:(over:ChannelRef, chan:ChannelRef, mode:(copy|move|bind))** - send a channel endpoint over another channel. Behavior varies depending on mode:
 * *copy* - a copy of chan is sent (see 'copy')
 * *move* - chan is detached from calling process (see 'close')
 * *bind* - new pipe created, move one end, bind other to chan.
* **c:accept:(from:ChannelRef, as:ChannelRef)** - receive a channel endpoint, locally binding to the 'as' ChannelRef. Fails if no input available or if next input is data or if 'as' ref is already bound.
* **c:pipe:(with:ChannelRef, and:ChannelRef, mode:(copy|move|bind))** - connect two channels such that messages received on one channel are automatically forwarded to the other, and vice versa. Behavior varies depending on mode:
 * *copy* - a copy of the channels is connected; original refs tap communications.
 * *move* - channels are both detached from calling pocess (see 'close').
 * *bind* - new pipe is created created, binding two refs. Forms a loopback connection.
* **c:copy:(of:ChannelRef, as:ChannelRef)** - duplicate a channel and its future content. Both original and copy will recv/accept the same inputs in the same order (transitively copying subchannels). Messages sent or subchannels attached to the original copy are both routed to the same destination.
* **c:close:ChannelRef** - detach from a channel, enabling host to recycle associated resources. Messages sent to a closed channel are dropped. Fails if ref is not in use. Closure can be observed via 'check'.
* **c:check:ChannelRef** - eventually detect whether a remote endpoint of a channel is closed. Fails if the channel is known to have no remote endpoints or pending inputs. Otherwise succeeds, returning unit. 

Each object is associated with a channel and is hosted by a process. Each method call is reified by a subchannel, such that results are easily routed back to the caller. That is, an object will 'accept' a channel per method call, and callers will 'attach' a channel per method call. An object can optionally handle requests sequentially or accept concurrent interaction. 

Compared to conventional OOP, performance requires efficient fine-grained concurrency, and we can conveniently extend request-response method call interactions with streaming, promise pipelining, lazy evaluation, multi-step protocols, etc.. Interfaces might better be described using session types instead of method lists. Distributed evaluation is very feasible.

### Reactive Dataflow Networks

An intruiging option is to communicate using only ephemeral connections. A short lifespan ensures that network connectivity and associated authority is visible, revocable, reactive to changes in code, configuration, or security policies. This is a useful guarantee for live coding, debugging, and open systems. However, continuous expiration and replacement of ephemeral connections is expensive. 

The cost can be mitigated by abstracting over expiration and replacement, such that we can incrementally compute the dynamic network structure. In context of transaction machines, this optimization is feasible if the API supports blind forwarding of data. Stable but reconfigurable connections can be represented in the transaction's stable prefix, and connections implicitly break when the transaction fails.

It is convenient for consistency if communication of data is similar to connections, e.g. represented in a transaction's stable prefix. This results in a reactive dataflow networks across process and application boundaries. Streaming data and message passing can be modeled above dataflow when needed. 

A viable API:

* **d:read:(from:DataflowChannel, mode:(list|fork|single))** - read a set of values currently available on a dataflow channel. Behavior depends on mode:
 * *list* - the set should be represented as a sorted list with arbitrary but stable order.
 * *fork* - returns a non-deterministic choice of value from the set, or fails if no data in set.
 * *single* - returns the only value from a singleton set, or fails if set is not a singleton.
* **d:write:(to:DataflowChannel, data:Value)** - add data to a dataflow channel. Writes within a transaction or between concurrent transactions are monotonic, idempotent, and commutative, being read as a set. Data implicitly expires from the set if not continuously written.
* **d:wire:(with:DataflowChannel, and:DataflowChannel)** - temporarily connect two channels, such that data that can be read from each channel is written to the other. Also applies transitively to subchannels. Wires expire unless continuously maintained.

A DataflowChannel might be represented by a concrete path, i.e. a `[List, Of, Values]`. The list represents hierarchical subchannels. Abstract references are neither necessary nor very useful in this case.

Dataflow channels are duplex by default. Reads and writes flow in different directions. Subchannels are the basis for fine-grained communication, e.g. a request-response pattern might involve writing a request then reading a subchannel whose name includes the request. Type systems can restrict direction of dataflow and use of subchannels.

A process will generally use a few standard channels, e.g. `[std:in]`, which are wired externally to form a composite process network. Standard channels should include a private loopback pair, because this would be very convenient for modeling hierarchical process networks without locally implementing the channels.
