# Glas Applications

Glas applications, at least for [Glas CLI](GlasCLI.md) verbs, will be modeled by a 1--1 arity program that represents a multi-step process over time where each step is atomically evaluated within a transaction.

        type Process = (init:Params | step:State) â†’ [Effects] (halt:Result | step:State) | Failure

An application process is started with 'init', voluntarily terminates by returning 'halt', or may return 'step' to continue in a future transaction, carrying state. Intermediate outputs and latent inputs can be modeled effectfully. Successful evaluation of steps may commit updates. Failure aborts the current transaction but will normally retry, implicitly waiting for changes or searching among non-deterministic options. 

This application model, which I call a *Transaction Machine*, has nice systemic properties regarding extensibility, composability, concurrency, distribution, reactivity, and live coding. Administrative control, debugging, and orthogonal persistence can be implemented as extensions that work with application state between steps. However, transaction machines depend on sophisticated optimizations. Implementation of the optimizer is the main development barrier for this model.

## Transaction Machines

Transaction machines model software systems as a set of repeating, atomic, isolated transactions in a shared environment. Scheduling of transactions is non-deterministic. This is a simple idea, but has many nice properties, especially when optimized.

### Waiting and Reactivity

If nothing changes, repeating a deterministic, unproductive transaction is guaranteed to again be unproductive. The system can recognize a simple subset of unproductive transactions and defer repetition until a relevant change occurs. Essentially, we can optimize a busy-wait into triggering updates on change.

The most obvious unproductive transaction is the failed transaction. Thus, aborting a transaction expresses waiting for changes. For example, if we abort a transaction after it fails to read from an empty channel, we'll implicitly wait on updates to the channel. Successful transactions are unproductive if we know repetition writes the same values to the same variables. Optimizing the success case would support spreadsheet-like evaluation of transaction machines.

Further, incremental computing can be supported. Instead of fully recomputing each transaction, it is feasible to implement repetition as rolling back to the earliest change in observed input and recomputing from there. We can design applications to take advantage of this optimization by first reading relatively stable variables, such as configuration data, then read unstable variables near end of transaction. This results in a tight 'step' loop that also reacts swiftly to changes in configuration data.

### Concurrency and Parallelism

Repeating a single transaction that makes a non-deterministic binary choice is equivalent to repeating two transactions that are identical before this choice then deterministically diverge. We can optimize non-deterministic choice using replication. Usefully, each replica can be stable under incremental computation. Introducing a non-deterministic choice effect enables a single repeating transaction to represent a dynamic set of repeating transactions.

Transactions in the set will interact via shared state. Useful interaction patterns such as channels and mailboxes can be modeled and typefully abstracted within shared state. Transactional updates and ability to wait on flexible conditions also mitigates many challenges of working directly with shared state.

Concurrent transactions can evaluate in parallel insofar as they avoid read-write conflict. When conflict does occur, one transaction will be aborted by the system while the other proceeds. The system can record a conflict history to heuristically schedule transactions to reduce risk of conflict. Additionally, applications can be architected to avoid conflict, using intermediate buffers and staging areas to reduce contention.

### Distribution 

Application state can be partitioned and mirrored across physically separated machines. A random distribution will be inefficient, requiring a distributed transaction for every step. With careful application design and annotation-guided distribution, we can arrange for most transactions to be machine-local, and further optimize most communication between machines.

For example, transaction machines can model a basic channel using a write buffer, a read buffer, and a data plumbing task that repeatedly moves data from (local) write buffer to (potentially remote) read buffer. Data previously in the read buffer is not observed and ideally shouldn't be serialized by this transaction. Ideally, the system would recognize this transaction and optimize it into a simple update message with acknowledgement.

Transaction machines are inherently resilient to network disruption. Operations within each network partition may continue unabated. Operations that communicate between network partitions fail temporarily, then implicitly continue when connectivity is re-established. This behavior is convenient for short-term disruption. Long-term disruption should be handled by weak synchronization patterns within the application, such as pushback buffers and heartbeats.

### Transaction Fusion

It is possible to apply [loop optimizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_optimization) to repeating transactions. Conceptually, we might view this as refining the non-deterministic transaction schedule. A random schedule isn't optimal because we must assume external updates to state between steps. By fusing transactions, we eliminate concurrent interference and enable optimization at the boundary. An optimizer can search for fusions that best improve performance. 

Fusion could be implemented by a just-in-time compiler based on empirical observations, or ahead-of-time based on static analysis. Intriguingly, just-in-time fusions can potentially optimize communication between multiple independent applications and services. In context of distributed transaction machines, each application or service essentially becomes an patch on a network overlay without violating security abstractions.

### Real-Time Systems 

Transaction machines can wait on the clock by (logically) aborting a transaction until a desired time is reached. Assuming the system knows the time the transaction is waiting for, the system can schedule the transaction precisely and efficiently, avoiding busy-waits from watching the clock. Usefully, the system can precompute a transaction slightly ahead of time, such that effects apply almost exactly on time.

Further, we could varify that critical transactions evaluate with worst-case timing under controllable stability assumptions. This enables "hard" real-time systems to be represented.

### Live Coding

The application program can be updated at runtime between transactions. This would naturally destabilize incremental computing and concurrent replicas, but those can be swiftly regenerated. Application state would immediately be handled by the updated transaction.

Transaction machines are only a partial solution for live coding. The application must also include transition logic for the state value, as needed, or must be careful to use a stable state type across application versions. Thus, support from the development environment is the other major part of the solution.

## Procedural Programming on Transaction Machines

Procedural code is a good fit for some applications, especially scripts. In context of a transaction machine, a procedure is evaluated over multiple transactional steps. Blocking calls are implicitly modeled by retry on step failure. A procedure's call-by-value parameters and return value can be represented with init and halt. The implicit continuation and local variables will be represented in the procedure's continuation.

Concurrency keywords and atomic blocks are useful extensions for procedural programs. To model concurrent interaction between procedure calls, we use shared variables or channels. Syntactically this can be represented similarly to pass-by-reference in many PLs. Reads and writes of the shared variables is probably best represented effectfully.

*Note:* Procedures can be separately compiled into transactional processes then composed. This is convenient for flexible integration. However, some optimizations will likely be easier to perform at the procedural layer. 

## Concrete Design

### Initial Performance Mitigation

Before optimizations are available, programmers should avoid use of concurrency. Failed transactions could cause evaluation to pause for a few milliseconds before retrying. There is no incremental computing, but programmers could use manual approaches such as maintaining an event queue or dirty bits in state. This is adequate for simple single-threaded apps, but it won't scale nicely to waiting on many input sources.

### Robust References

Conventional APIs return allocated references to the client, e.g. `open file` returns a file handle. However, this design is unstable under concurrency and difficult to secure. A more robust API design for references is to have applications allocate their own references. For example, `open file as foo` where `foo` is a user-provided value. 

Further operations such as read and close would then use `foo` value to reference the open file. The host would maintain a translation table between application references and runtime objects. Compared to system allocation of references, it is much easier to secure which references a subprogram may use, e.g. based on prefix. References can be stable and meaningful, which should simplify debugging and reflection. Allocation of references can be decentralized, reducing contention on a central allocator.

### Asynchronous Effects

Effects must be aborted when evaluation fails. Compared to distributed transactions, it's a lot easier to write messages into a local buffer then send on commit. Ease of implementation will impact API designs, favoring asynchronous effects.

A useful exception is stable, cacheable reads. For example, loading a module from the module system, or reading a file's content, or even HTTP GET could potentially be performed within a transaction. In some cases, we might also read the age or staleness of the cached value.

## Common Effects APIs

Effects should be designed for transaction machines yet suitable for procedural code to simplify embeddings.

### Time

Transactions are logically instantaneous. The concept of 'timeout' or 'sleep' is incompatible with transactions. However, we can constrain a transaction to commit before or after a given time. We can also estimate time of commit then abort if the estimate is too far off. Proposed effects API:

* **time:now** - Response is an estimated, logical time of commit, as a TimeStamp value.
* **time:check:TimeStamp** - If 'now' is equal or greater to TimeStamp, respond with unit. Otherwise fail.

Time 'check' provides stable, monotonic, indirect observation of time. If a transaction aborts after a failed time check, the runtime can implicitly wait for specified time (or other relevant changes) to retry. Time check is useful for modeling timeouts and scheduling.

Reading 'now' will destabilize a transaction because time is always advancing in the background. But this is not a problem if the time is read after another destabilizing input. For example, we could use 'now' after reading from an input channel to associate a received timestamp with each incoming message.

By default, timestamps are in NT time: a natural number of 100ns intervals since midnight Jan 1, 1601 UT. 

### Concurrency

Repetition and replication are equivalent for isolated transactions. In context of a transaction machine, within the stable prefix of a transaction, fork can be implemented efficiently by replication, essentially spawning a thread for each stable choice. Outside this context, fork can be implemented as probabilistic choice.

* **fork** - non-deterministic behavior, respond with '0' or '1' bitstring.

Fork is abstractly a function of time. Relevantly, a hierarchical transaction may observe 'fork' backtracking within logically frozen time, but there is no history maintained between transactions or procedural steps.

### Distribution

Application state is represented in the `step:State` tree value. Instead of partitioning and replicating variables across machines, we'll break the tree into stable component branches then distribute those. 

The read and write buffers for a channel can be represented by lists on two different machines. We can mirror stable regions of the tree for efficient read-only access. Distributed application programs should include annotations and types to support intelligent distribution and resist accidental performance degradation.

Effects APIs should also be extended to work with machine-specific resources. A viable, non-invasive option is to wrap machine-local effects with an explicit location, e.g. `at:(loc:MachineRef, do:LocalEffect)`. Transactions that reference multiple locations can be useful and would be implemented as distributed transactions, but should be avoided in normal use cases. 

### Logging

Logging is a convenient approach to debugging. We can easily support a logging effect. Alternatively, we could introduce logging as a special debugging annotation, similar to breakpoints and profiling. 

* **log:Message** - Response is unit. Arbitrary output message, useful for progress reports or debugging.

By convention, a log message should be a record of ad-hoc fields, whose meanings are de-facto standardized, such as `(lv:warn, text:"I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.", from:hal)`. This enables the record to be extended with metadata or new features.

In context of transaction machines and fork-based concurrency, logs might be presented as a stable tree (aligned with forks) potentially with unstable leaf nodes. Logically, the entire tree updates, every frame, but log messages in the stable prefix of a fork will also be stable outputs. Further, messages logged by failed transactions might be observable indirectly via reflection, perhaps rendered in a distinct color.

### Random Data

For optimization and security purposes, it's useful to distinguish non-deterministic choice from random data. Random reads are unstable for purpose of incremental computing. 

* **random:Count** - response is requested count of cryptographically, uniformly random bits, represented as a bitstring. E.g. `random:8` might return `00101010`. 

Applications should often use deterministic pseudo-random data or noise models (such as Perlin noise) instead of external random data. However, sometimes we need the closest thing to true random data.

## Misc Thoughts

### Console Applications

See [Glas command line interface](GlasCLI.md).

### Web Applications

Another promising near-term target for Glas is web applications, compiling apps to JavaScript and using effects oriented around on Document Object Model, XMLHttpRequest, WebSockets, and Local Storage. Transaction machines are a good fit for web apps, I think.

### Process Networks

We can model process networks or flow-based programming with a relatively simple effects API for operations on external channels:

* **send:(over:ChannelRef, data:Value)** - write arbitrary data to a named channel.
* **recv:(from:ChannelRef)** - read data from a named channel. Fails if read buffer is empty or next input is not data.

References are local to each process in this API. Each process might begin with a set of open channels whose names are indicative of their role or purpose, and the channels of multiple processes could be externally wired to form a composite network process. 

In some cases, we might want to model dynamic process networks, which statefully evolve from the initial configuration. This can be supported with some extensions to the API that make the configuration of channels clear to the composite process:

* **attach:(over:ChannelRef, as:NewChannelRef)** - send one end of a new duplex channel over an existing channel. One end of the new channel is bound locally to the given new channel name.
* **accept:(from:ChannelRef, as:NewChannelRef)** - receive a duplex channel from an existing channel, attach to specified local endpoint. Fails if read buffer is empty or next input is not a channel endpoint.
* **close:ChannelRef** - tell system the process is done with specified channel.
* **wire:(from:ChannelRef, to:ChannelRef)** - tell system to permanently connect two channels, forwarding any unhandled or future messages and events between them. Closes both channels as far as the process is concerned.

Between attach, accept, and wire it is possible to establish new point-to-point connections between nodes in the network without ever directly sharing a channel reference.

### Object-Oriented Programming in Glas Applications

Conventional OOP with *synchronous* method calls is an awkward fit for Glas programs and processes. A parent process can provide an effects API with references to share objects with a child process, such as open file handles. But the child process cannot conveniently return objects to the parent.

It is feasible to use dynamic process networks APIs to model asynchronous objects. For example:

        Object Client:
            attach:(over:ObjectRef, as:RequestRef)
            send:(over:RequestRef, data:RequestValue)
            (... commit to actually send data ...)
            recv:(from:RequestRef)  // blocking read!
            close:RequestRef

        Object Server:
            accept:(from:ObjectRef, as:RequestRef)
            recv:(from:RequestRef) 
            (... zero or more steps ...)
            send:(over:RequestRef, data:ResponseValue)
            close:RequestRef

In this case, we have simple request and response values. More generally, we might use attach and accept to support fine-grained subtask interactions or model object-passing. However, this API would become very inefficient for fine-grained use compared to conventional OOP.
