    // bootstrap. Transaction machine optimizations, including the essential ones:
    // incremental computing and concurrent replication on fork, are not features 
    // that I want to implement twice. Additionally, some dotnet API decisions

    // non-blocking reads.

    // by `LoadModule.fs`, so this module only provides a mechanism for backtracking
    // and some support for logging.
